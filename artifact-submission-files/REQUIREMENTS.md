# Requirements

- Docker
    - Instructions to install Docker are available [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- Docker Compose
    - Instructions to install Docker Compose are available [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose).

**Note:** You need to have a system running on either
- GNU/Linux
- Windows 10 64bit: Pro, Enterprise or Education (Build 15063 or later)
- macOS Sierra 10.12 or newer on a hardware from at least 2010

If your system does not match any of the requirements above, you must install a virtual machine.
[This tutorial](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-Ubuntu-on-VirtualBox) may help you.

**Note:** By default, on a GNU/Linux host, Docker commands must be run using `sudo`. Two options are available for you in order to run symfinder:
- Follow [these short steps](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user) to allow your user to call Docker commands,
- Preface the scripts calls with `sudo`.

Your Docker installation should be allowed to allocate at least 3Go of RAM and 1Go of swap.
The container for VariCity might be automatically killed at its start otherwise.
On Linux host systems, Docker has no limitation on the resources it can allocate. On Windows and Mac systems, you can check for these settings: 
- If you use a Windows system, in [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#resources).
- If you use a Mac system, in [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#resources).

A web browser is also needed to display the visualizations generated by VariCity. The visualization has been tested using:
- Google Chrome (provides the best experience in terms of fluidity)
- Mozilla Firefox
- Safari
- Microsoft Edge
